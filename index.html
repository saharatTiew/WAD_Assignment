        <p>Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized by altered consciousness, relatively
            inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles during
            rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and reduced interactions with surroundings. It is distinguished from
            wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but more reactive than a coma or disorders of
            consciousness, with sleep displaying very different and active brain patterns.</p>

        <h1>Non-REM and REM sleep</h1>
        <p>Sleep is divided into two broad types: non-rapid eye movement (non-REM or NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement
            (REM) sleep. Non-REM and REM sleep are so different that physiologists identify them as distinct behavioral
            states. Non-REM sleep occurs first and after a transitional period is called slow-wave sleep or deep sleep.
            During this phase, body temperature and heart rate fall, and the brain uses less energy. REM sleep, also
            known as paradoxical sleep, represents a smaller portion of total sleep time. It is the main occasion for
            dreams (or nightmares), and is associated with desynchronized and fast brain waves, eye movements, loss of
            muscle tone, and suspension of homeostasis.</p>
